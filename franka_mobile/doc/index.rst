franka_mobile
=============

Package Overview
----------------

This package contains the controllers needed for franka tmr swerve drive robot, both in simulation and on real hardware.

Controllers
--------------------

The package provides:

* ``franka_mobile/swerve_drive_controller``: this is the main drive controller for the tmr. Its main features are:
    - subscribes to `geometry_msgs::msg::TwistStamped` messages on ``~/cmd_vel`` 
    - publishes to `/tf` the odometry transformation between `world` and `base_link`. Frame names are configurable
    - publishes to `~/odom` the `nav_msgs::msg::Odometry` containing the twist coming from the robot's master controller or simulation.
    - writes to a loaned `franka_semantic_components::CartesianVelocity` command interface to send the desired twist to the robot (either real or simulated).
    - Both state and reference interfaces are configurable with prefixes for chaining purposes.
* ``franka_mobile/swerve_ik_controller``: this controller is needed for simulation purposes, e.g. with gazebo. Its main features are:
    - Reads/writes from/to `joint/position` and `joint/velocity` state/command interface exposes by `gz_ros2_control` plugins.
    - Performs the forward/inverse kinematics computation needed to replicated the master controller's behaviour.
    - Exports a `franka_semantic_components::CartesianVelocityInterface` as reference interface.
    - Exports a `franka_semantic_components::CartesianPoseInterface` as state interface.
    - Both state and reference interfaces are configurable with prefixes for chaining purposes.
    

Both these controllers are derived from ``controller_interface::ChainableControllerInterface`` and can be composed with other controllers
that adhere to the same state/reference interfaces exposed. 
Please look the the ros2 control documentation for more informations about chaining controllers.

Configuration
-------------

Please look into the `config/swerve_drive_controller_parameters.yaml` for available overrides in your yaml files.

Battery service
---------------

ROS 2 interface for the Franka TMR Battery REST API
(``https://<robot_ip>/battery/api``), using only standard message types.

Launch
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch franka_mobile battery.launch.py robot_ip:=172.16.0.1

Topic
^^^^^

By default the node publishes ``sensor_msgs/BatteryState`` on
``/franka_battery_node/battery_state`` at 1 Hz (parameters ``enable_battery_topic``
and ``publish_rate``).

Services
^^^^^^^^

Wireless charging control uses ``std_srvs/Trigger``:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /franka_battery_node/stop_wireless_charging std_srvs/srv/Trigger
   ros2 service call /franka_battery_node/try_start_wireless_charging std_srvs/srv/Trigger
