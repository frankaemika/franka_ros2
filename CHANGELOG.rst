Changelog for package franka_ros2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

v3.5.3 (2026-09-01)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.9.0 requires ROS 2 Jazzy

* fix: spine ``~/halt`` and ``move_absolute`` cancel did not stop the carriage.
  ``halt_motion()`` posted to ``/spine/api/motion:halt``, which the device does
  not implement (404). It now uses ``motion:quick-stop``, re-arms to
  ``SwitchedOn`` after the DS402 stop, overlaps halt and feedback with the
  blocking ``motion-mm:start`` on one HTTP client, and does not report a goal
  canceled when halt fails.
* fix: spine ``http_timeout`` (default 3 s) is only the connect timeout and the
  budget for short REST. ``motion-mm:start`` uses ``(http_timeout, 600 s)`` so
  a long move is not aborted by the short read; the motion lock stays held
  until that POST returns.
* refactor: spine REST wire strings live in ``SpineStatus`` (DS402 states) and
  ``SpineMotion`` (``Finished``).
* fix: ``move_absolute`` no longer surfaces HTTP 424 when the spine is not
  ``SwitchedOn``. It checks state first and reports e.g.
  ``Cannot start motion: spine is SwitchedOff (expected SwitchedOn)``.
* fix: ``franka_mobile_fr3_duo_moveit_config`` test fixed for new franka hardware
  compensation plugin.

v3.5.2 (2026-08-17)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.9.0 requires ROS 2 Jazzy

* fix: updated franka_description to 2.9.0

v3.5.1 (2026-08-14)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.9.0 requires ROS 2 Jazzy

* fix: accelerometers data is float in libfranka 0.20.5

v3.5.0 (2026-08-14)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.9.0 requires ROS 2 Jazzy

* feat: add TMR battery ROS 2 support in ``franka_mobile`` (``sensor_msgs/BatteryState``
  topic at 1 Hz and ``std_srvs/Trigger`` services for wireless charging), with an
  internal ``franka_desk_api`` HTTPS helper used by the spine and battery clients.
* fix: franka_hardware tests now run in isolated ROS domains to avoid possible collisions.
* fix: fixed franka_hardware stop motion test to check for stopping_joint_positions matching the last 
        commanded target instead of zero positions. 
* fix: tune mobile teleop velocity/acceleration limits to stay within the RCU
  2-norm bounds. Raise swerve translational limits to 0.35 m/s / 0.4 m/s^2 and
  rotational to 0.5 rad/s / 0.3 rad/s^2 in ``controllers.yaml``, rescale the xbox
  normal/turbo axes in ``xbox.config.yaml`` to match ``max_velocity``, and reduce
  the joystick deadzone (0.1) with a higher autorepeat rate (50 Hz) in
  ``mobile_teleop.launch.py`` for smoother teleop.
* fix: the description extension entry points and the mobile fr3 duo moveit config no longer
  hardcode the franka hand's tcp offset, so a cobot pump mounted on them is placed at its own
  ``0 0 0.105`` instead of the hand's ``0 0 0.1034``. Requires franka_description with the resolved
  ``tcp_xyz`` default. MIGRATION: pass ``tcp_xyz`` explicitly to keep the previous value; the franka
  hand is unaffected.
* fix: **BREAKING CHANGE** thread-safe access to robot state interface (changed from RealtimeBuffer to RealtimeThreadSafeBox).
  This fixes possible race conditions that could happen when running the broadcaster and the 
  cartesian impedance example controller (e.g. via the `franka_semantic_components::FrankaRobotModel`) with async=true. 
  Users of the `franka_semantic_components::FrankaRobotState` should be not impacted, only direct state interface users claiming the hardware interface.
* fix: default thread priority for franka_hardware interface threads is now 98 (was 50) to 
  ensure RT stability.
* fix: recover from a ``franka::ControlException`` without restarting
  ``ros2_control_node``. ``franka_robot_state_broadcaster`` and
  ``joint_state_broadcaster`` stay lifecycle-active. One update cycle may
  publish the pre-fault / frozen sample after ``read()`` latches, then the
  controller-manager update thread blocks for the approximately two-second
  braking stop and topic publication pauses; after the block, inactive-state
  reads resume and publish live reflex state. After clearing the robot error,
  only the command controller needs reactivation.
* docu: add an umbrella guide for the relocated description extensions,
  including composition layers, mounting points, prefix rules, and external
  gripper attachment.
* docs: comprehensive documentation audit and fixes across 12 packages — corrected
  inaccurate launch arguments, removed references to non-existent files, fixed API method
  names, updated parameter names to match code, added undocumented launch args, improved
  grammar and user experience. Fixed tuple default bug in
  franka_vision_and_manipulation_kit launch file.
* fix: align MoveIt gripper controller name with actual gripper node name.
  ``fr3_controllers.yaml`` and ``moveit.launch.py`` referenced ``fr3_gripper``
  but the node is launched as ``franka_gripper``, breaking gripper action commands
  and joint state aggregation in MoveIt. (GitHub PR #206)
* test: comprehensive no-hardware test suite

  - Add controller load test covering all 16 example controllers (one GTest case each)
  - Add launch file parsing validation for 19 first-party launch files
  - Add fake-hardware integration tests (controller spawn, activate, verify)
  - Add fake-hardware test config files
    (``test_fake_hardware_{fr3,fr3_duo,mobile_fr3_duo,tmr}.config.yaml``)
  - Register ``test_gripper_topic_consistency.py`` in franka_fr3_moveit_config

* ci: improve Jenkins pipeline test coverage

  - Fix package regex to include ``mobile_fr3_duo_trajectory_controller`` and
    ``franka_bringup`` structural tests (previously silently dropped)
  - Isolate Gazebo tests into separate optional stage
  - Add ``executeGazeboTests`` parameter (default: false)

* fix: add missing dependencies in package.xml for isolated builds
  (``rclcpp_components`` in franka_hardware; ``rclcpp_lifecycle``, ``urdf``, ``eigen``,
  ``controller_interface`` in franka_semantic_components). Fixes rosdep-based
  fresh-environment builds. (community contribution: GitHub PRs #96, #169)
* refactor: decoupled simulation backend selection from the franka_hardware ros2_control
  macros and removed all Gazebo-specific content from franka_description. The hardware
  ``<plugin>`` block (real / mock / gazebo) and the gz_ros2_control ``<gazebo>`` system
  element are now injected by the owning package (franka_bringup for real/mock, franka_gazebo
  for gazebo) instead of being selected by ``xacro:if`` inside franka_hardware. Mode and
  interface selection moved up to the entry-point URDFs as implementation-agnostic capability
  flags (effort command, finger joint, passive base, self-collision geometry), replacing the
  former ``gazebo`` / ``gazebo_effort`` semantic flags. franka_description no longer contains
  any Gazebo tags, macros, or arguments — the Gazebo SDF/transmission machinery, the world
  anchor, and self-collision suppression now live in franka_gazebo, making franka_description
  simulator-agnostic. All robot × mode URDF expansions remain byte-identical to before the
  refactor.

v3.4.1 (2026-07-07)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.8.0 requires ROS 2 Jazzy

* feat: add tmr launch file in franka bringup and use it for the mobile teleop launch file

v3.4.0 (2026-06-23)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.8.0 requires ROS 2 Jazzy

* feat: expose ``K_F_ext_hat_K`` as ``ForceTorqueSensor`` state interfaces (force.x/y/z,
  torque.x/y/z) on the ``<arm_prefix><robot_type>_tcp`` sensor, enabling direct wrench
  consumption at control frequency without a topic bridge.
* fix(franka_mobile): enable jerk limiting on the swerve_drive_controller velocity
  limiter (linear x/y, angular z) so the commanded base velocity ramps with a bounded
  acceleration onset, preventing the firmware ``cartesian_motion_generator_velocity_discontinuity``
  reflex from aborting base motion when switching between whole-body and base-only control.
  The rate-limiter timestep is fixed at the nominal 1 kHz control period.
* BREAKING CHANGE: collision_detected topic now uses best_effort QoS (SensorDataQoS);
  thread-safe atomics for collision state in example controllers.
  Subscribers using the default ``reliable`` QoS will no longer receive messages.
  To migrate, set the subscriber QoS to ``best_effort`` (``SensorDataQoS``):

  .. code-block:: cpp

     // Before (default reliable QoS — no longer receives messages):
     auto sub = node->create_subscription<std_msgs::msg::Bool>(
         "collision_detected", 1, callback);

     // After (best_effort QoS):
     auto sub = node->create_subscription<std_msgs::msg::Bool>(
         "collision_detected", rclcpp::SensorDataQoS(), callback);
* refactor: Removed the robot_description from launch files - controller_manager gets it natively via topic
* docu: Added documentation for error recovery after an FCI error.
* fix: Pinocchios collision detection component dropped the 'fcl/hpp' namespace and only supports now the coal namespace
* feat: added a model-based gravity-compensation system plugin
  (``franka_gazebo_hardware::GazeboGravityCompensationSystem``) for gz_ros2_control that
  injects pinocchio-computed gravity torque on the effort-controlled arm joints, so the
  zero-torque example controllers behave in Gazebo as on the real robot (where the master
  controller performs gravity compensation) instead of collapsing under gravity.
* chore: restructured the Gazebo support into two packages under the ``franka_gazebo/``
  grouping folder: ``franka_gazebo_bringup`` (launch/world/urdf/config assets) and
  ``franka_gazebo_hardware`` (the gz system plugin). The public launch command
  ``ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup <file>`` is unchanged; the plugin is now referenced as
  ``franka_gazebo_hardware/GazeboGravityCompensationSystem``.
* chore: removed the per-link ``<gravity>false</gravity>`` xacro overrides; gravity is now
  enabled globally in the Gazebo world. This is engine-independent (the previous approach
  relied on a gz-fortress gravity-disable behavior that is not forwarded by some physics
  engines). Simulation-only behavior change; no impact on real-robot users.
* feat: hold the mobile platform (``mobile_fr3_duo_v0_2``) prismatic
  ``franka_spine_vertical_joint`` against gravity with a ``spine_joint_trajectory_controller``
  (JointTrajectoryController on a position command interface) that holds the column at its
  initial height.

v3.3.0 (2026-05-04)
-------------------

* chore: removed vendored controller_manager
* feat: Added `franka_mobile` package with `swerve_drive_controller` (tf and odom support) and `swerve_ik_controller` for gazebo sim.
* docu: Maintenance work on documentation
* feat: add franka_vision_and_manipulation_kit package with urdf descriptions and launch files for the Franka Vision and Manipulation Kit
* refactor: replace blocking mutex in franka_robot_state_broadcaster with lock-free AsyncBuffer
* BREAKING CHANGE: franka_robot_state_broadcaster convenience topics are published with best_effort QoS
* chore: Added a CI job to try backporting jazzy to humble
* BREAKING CHANGE: franka_robot_state_broadcaster convenience topics are published with best_effort QoS.
  Topics affected: ``current_pose``, ``stiffness_frame_wrench``, and all other convenience topics
  from the broadcaster. Subscribers using the default ``reliable`` QoS will no longer receive
  messages. To migrate, set the subscriber QoS to ``best_effort``:

  **C++ (rclcpp)**

  .. code-block:: cpp

     // Before (default reliable QoS — no longer receives messages):
     auto sub = node->create_subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped>(
         "current_pose", 10, callback);

     // After (best_effort QoS):
     rclcpp::QoS qos(10);
     qos.best_effort();
     auto sub = node->create_subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped>(
         "current_pose", qos, callback);

  **Python (rclpy)**

  .. code-block:: python

     # Before (default reliable QoS — no longer receives messages):
     self.create_subscription(PoseStamped, 'current_pose', callback, 10)

     # After (best_effort QoS):
     from rclpy.qos import QoSProfile, ReliabilityPolicy
     qos = QoSProfile(depth=10, reliability=ReliabilityPolicy.BEST_EFFORT)
     self.create_subscription(PoseStamped, 'current_pose', callback, qos)

* feat: Updated franka_selfcollision package to support mobile_fr3_duo in addition to fr3_duo
* fix: resolve segfault caused by ABI mismatch between hardware_interface and controller_manager **C++ (rclcpp)**
* chore: Unify ros2_control (Jazzy) sources to avoid ABI mismatches (add ros2_control to dependency.repos so hardware_interface/controller_manager build from the same ABI;
remove the standalone hardware_interface fork; keep manage_overruns for async hardware components via a small patch auto-applied in franka_entrypoint.sh).
**BREAKING**: existing workspaces must be cleaned before rebuilding: ``rm -rf build/ install/ && colcon build``
* fix: Removed the `franka_robot_state_broadcaster` while using the TMR
* fix: With async control, it could happen that the robot_state is teared while publishing. This fix provides a
